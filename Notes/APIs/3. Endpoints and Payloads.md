# Endpoints and Payloads

## 1. Overview

- Organize API Endpoints
- Handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
- Parse the request path and body
- Use POST, PATCH, and DELETE requests in Flask
- Handle Errors

To accomplish this use the library _Flask-CORS_

## 2. Organizing API Endpoints

When organizing API endpoints, they should be based on the resources instead of on actions. The request methods will deteermine what action should be taken at a given URL endpoint. Your entire API's scheme should be consistent, clear and concise.

- **Should be intuitive**
- **Organize by resource**
  - Use nouns in the path, not verbs
  - The method used will determine the operation taken
  - GOOD:
    - https://example.com/posts
      BAD:
    - https://example.com/get_posts
- **Keep a consistent scheme**
  - Plural nouns for collections
  - Use parameters to specify a specific item
  - GOOD:
    - https://example.com/entrees
    - https://example.com/entrees/5
  - BAD:
    - https://example.com/entree
    - https://example.com/entree_five
- **Don’t make them too complex or lengthy**
  - No longer than collection/item/collection
  - GOOD:
    - https://example.com/entrees/5/reviews
  - BAD:
    - https://example.com/entrees/5/customers/4/reviews

### Methods & Endpoints Review

The request method will determine the operation performed for the given resource URI. Though your API documentation should explain exactly what operation is performed and data returned via the repsonse, it should be intuitive for anyone using your API, such as in the example below.

> Endpoints should be organized by resource and in the structure of `collection/item/collection`. i.e. `genres/1/movies` should access all movies related to genre `1`.

> You cannot `POST` to an endpoint to a single resource. That resource already exists, and `POST` creates an entirely new resource

POST - Creates new resources

> The POST verb is most-often utilized to **create** new resources. In particular, it's used to create subordinate resources. That is, subordinate to some other (e.g. parent) resource. In other words, when creating a new resource, POST to the parent and the service takes care of associating the new resource with the parent, assigning an ID (new resource URI), etc.

> On successful creation, return HTTP status 201, returning a Location header with a link to the newly-created resource with the 201 HTTP status.

> POST is neither safe nor idempotent. It is therefore recommended for non-idempotent resource requests. Making two identical POST requests will most-likely result in two resources containing the same information.

> Examples:

    POST http://www.example.com/customers
    POST http://www.example.com/customers/12345/orders

GET

> The HTTP GET method is used to **read** (or retrieve) a representation of a resource. In the “happy” (or non-error) path, GET returns a representation in XML or JSON and an HTTP response code of 200 (OK). In an error case, it most often returns a 404 (NOT FOUND) or 400 (BAD REQUEST.

> According to the design of the HTTP specification, GET (along with HEAD) requests are used only to read data and not change it. Therefore, when used this way, they are considered safe. That is, they can be called without risk of data modification or corruption—calling it once has the same effect as calling it 10 times, or none at all. Additionally, GET (and HEAD) is idempotent, which means that making multiple identical requests ends up having the same result as a single request.

> Do not expose unsafe operations via GET—it should never modify any resources on the server.

> Examples:

    GET http://www.example.com/customers/12345
    GET http://www.example.com/customers/12345/orders
    GET http://www.example.com/buckets/sample

PUT - Replaces the entire representation

> is most-often utilized for **update** capabilities, PUT-ing to a known resource URI with the request body containing the newly-updated representation of the original resource.

> However, PUT can also be used to create a resource in the case where the resource ID is chosen by the client instead of by the server. In other words, if the PUT is to a URI that contains the value of a non-existent resource ID. Again, the request body contains a resource representation. Many feel this is convoluted and confusing. Consequently, this method of creation should be used sparingly, if at all.

> Alternatively, use POST to create new resources and provide the client-defined ID in the body representation—presumably to a URI that doesn't include the ID of the resource (see POST below).

> On successful update, return 200 (or 204 if not returning any content in the body) from a PUT. If using PUT for create, return HTTP status 201 on successful creation. A body in the response is optional—providing one consumes more bandwidth. It is not necessary to return a link via a Location header in the creation case since the client already set the resource ID.

> PUT is not a safe operation, in that it modifies (or creates) state on the server, but it is idempotent. In other words, if you create or update a resource using PUT and then make that same call again, the resource is still there and still has the same state as it did with the first call.

> If, for instance, calling PUT on a resource increments a counter within the resource, the call is no longer idempotent. Sometimes that happens and it may be enough to document that the call is not idempotent. However, it's recommended to keep PUT requests idempotent. It is strongly recommended to use POST for non-idempotent requests.

> Examples:

    PUT http://www.example.com/customers/12345
    PUT http://www.example.com/customers/12345/orders/98765
    PUT http://www.example.com/buckets/secret_stuff

PATCH - Responsible for partial updates of a resource

> is used for **modify** capabilities. The PATCH request only needs to contain the changes to the resource, not the complete resource.

> This resembles PUT, but the body contains a set of instructions describing how a resource currently residing on the server should be modified to produce a new version. This means that the PATCH body should not just be a modified part of the resource, but in some kind of patch language like JSON Patch or XML Patch.

> PATCH is neither safe nor idempotent. However, a PATCH request can be issued in such a way as to be idempotent, which also helps prevent bad outcomes from collisions between two PATCH requests on the same resource in a similar time frame. Collisions from multiple PATCH requests may be more dangerous than PUT collisions because some patch formats need to operate from a known base-point or else they will corrupt the resource. Clients using this kind of patch application should use a conditional request such that the request will fail if the resource has been updated since the client last accessed the resource. For example, the client can use a strong ETag in an If-Match header on the PATCH request.

> Examples:

    PATCH http://www.example.com/customers/12345
    PATCH http://www.example.com/customers/12345/orders/98765
    PATCH http://www.example.com/buckets/secret_stuff

DELETE

> is pretty easy to understand. It is used to **delete** a resource identified by a URI.

> On successful deletion, return HTTP status 200 (OK) along with a response body, perhaps the representation of the deleted item (often demands too much bandwidth), or a wrapped response (see Return Values below). Either that or return HTTP status 204 (NO CONTENT) with no response body. In other words, a 204 status with no body, or the JSEND-style response and HTTP status 200 are the recommended responses.

> HTTP-spec-wise, DELETE operations are idempotent. If you DELETE a resource, it's removed. Repeatedly calling DELETE on that resource ends up the same: the resource is gone. If calling DELETE say, decrements a counter (within the resource), the DELETE call is no longer idempotent. As mentioned previously, usage statistics and measurements may be updated while still considering the service idempotent as long as no resource data is changed. Using POST for non-idempotent resource requests is recommended.

> There is a caveat about DELETE idempotence, however. Calling DELETE on a resource a second time will often return a 404 (NOT FOUND) since it was already removed and therefore is no longer findable. This, by some opinions, makes DELETE operations no longer idempotent, however, the end-state of the resource is the same. Returning a 404 is acceptable and communicates accurately the status of the call.

> Examples:

    DELETE http://www.example.com/customers/12345
    DELETE http://www.example.com/customers/12345/orders
    DELETE http://www.example.com/bucket/sample

## 3. CORS

- Security and the Same-Origin Policy
- Block requests from rogue Javascript
  > allows scripts in Webpage 1 to access data from Webpage 2 only if they share the same domain.

This means this error `No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource` will be reaised in the following cases:

- Different domains
- Different subdomains (example.com and api.example.com)
- Different ports (example.com and example.com:1234)
- Different protocols (http://example.com and https://example.com)

> Even though it raises an error it isn't an error, it is there to protect you and your users. E.g. attackers may embed malicious scripts in advertisements. This policy prevents those scripts from successfully making requests to your bank's website as you access the website hosting the advertisement.

Why care?

- Rogue or malicious scripts exist
- Ability to complete non-simple requests (beyond some basic headers)
  - Preflight OPTIONS request
  - No CORS, no request sent
- It protects you and your users
-

### CORS headers

- Access-Control-Allow-Origin

  - What client domains can access its resources. For any domain use\*

- Access-Control-Allow-Credentials

  - Only if using cookies for auth - in which case its value must be true

- Access-Control-Allow-Methods

  - List of HTTPS request types allowed

- Access-Control-Allow-Methods
  - List of https request header values the server will allow, particularly useful if you use any custom headers

## 4. Flask-CORS

Install CORS via pip3 `pip3 install flask-cors`

View this file in `../../APIs/Basics/**init**.py

```
from flask import Flask, jsonfiy
from flask_cors import CORS
from models import setup_db, Plant

def create_app(test_config=None):
    app = Flask(__name__)
    setup.db(app)
    CORS(app)

    @app.after_request
    def after_request(response):
        response.headers.add('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type, Authorization')
        response.headers.add('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS')

    @app.route('/')
    def hello():
        return jsonify({'message': 'HELLO WORLD'})

    return app
```

If the app should only be allowed specific domains to access resources or only allow cross-origin for specific routes, enable with the following.
`resources={r"*/api/*": {origins: '*'}}) # after the comma - make a resources object, first element specifies what resources are being talked about the second speicifes what origins from the client can access those resources at that type of URI.`
```
    @cross_origin # This allows you to specify endpoints
```

## 5. Flask Part II
Learn and practice making complex GET requests and additional requests using CORS, and basic error handling.

### Variable Rules
In order to handle variablilty in Flask, you add a `<variable_name>` within the path argument of the `@app.route` decorator, which is then passed to the function as a keyword argument variable_name.

You can also specify the type of argument by using `<converter:variable_name>` syntax

```
@app.route('/entrees/<int:entree_id>')
def retrieve_entree(entree_id):
    return 'Entree %d' % entree_id
```

### HTTP Methods
By default, the `@app.route` decorator answers only get requests. In order to enable more request types, pass the method parameter to the decorate including a list of string methods.
```
@app.route('/hello', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def greeting():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        return create_greeting()
    else:
        return send_greeting()
```

OPTIONS request are automatically implemented and HEAD is also automatically implemented if GET is present.
